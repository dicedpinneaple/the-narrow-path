# 1. THE EXPERIENCE PILLARS

The three immutable principles defining what the player experience must be.


---

1.1. PILLAR 1 — Moral Ambiguity as Gameplay

The player must never be told what is right or wrong.
Judgment is a mechanic, not a theme.

Every character is morally complex.

Every explanation has a competing explanation.

The cult is both “cult-like” and sincerely helpful.

Sparse, incomplete information forces the player to think instead of react.


> The game’s purpose is not to guide morality. It is to challenge certainty.




---

1.2. PILLAR 2 — Knowledge Unlocks Narrative

Player progression is not based on combat or leveling; it is based on understanding.

The more the player learns about numerology, astrology, and pagan rituals, the more narrative paths open.

Misunderstanding closes paths.

Early judgment shortcuts the game, leading to shallow endings.

True depth requires engagement and curiosity.


> Knowledge is the primary resource. Ignorance is the primary fail state.




---

1.3. PILLAR 3 — Human-Scale Drama in a Mystical Frame

The story is intimate, not epic.

No demons, no cosmic catastrophes.

Rituals are personal, grounded, therapeutic.

Esotericism is portrayed respectfully and realistically, without horror tropes.

Conflicts are emotional, cultural, psychological.


> Mysticism is a lens for humanity, not a threat to it.




---

# 2. THE THEMATIC PILLARS


---

2.1. Theme 1 — Context Is Meaning

Words like cult, ritual, belief, and magic change depending on who uses them and why.
The game confronts players with the danger of judging without understanding context.


---

2.2. Theme 2 — Crossroads

Every character is at a crossroads.
Every ritual symbolizes a crossroad.
The player arrives at a crossroads of their own: ambition vs integrity.


---

2.3. Theme 3 — The Tension Between Urban Rationalism and Rural Spirituality

The city sees superstition.
The valley sees tradition.
The truth is somewhere in between.


---

# 3. AESTHETIC PILLARS


---

3.1. Tone

Quiet

Introspective

Suspicious but never paranoid

Gentle mysticism

Slow revelation

Emotional realism



---

3.2. Visual Style

Earth tones, birch-white, charcoal, muted greens

Hand-drawn textures

Minimalistic UI with occult touches

Symbolic overlays (numbers, runes, tallies) used sparingly



---

3.3. Audio Style

Ambient drones

Natural field recordings

Occasional folk instruments (lyre, drum, bowed dulcimer)

Soft choral chanting for ritual scenes



---

# 4. DESIGN PILLARS


---

4.1. No Combat, No Horror, No Jump Scares

Player challenge comes from:

deduction

emotional inference

choices under uncertainty

interpretation of symbols



---

4.2. Player Agency Through Knowledge

The world gates progression through understanding of:

Numerology (Life Path, master numbers, cycles)

Astrology (transits, returns, seasonal symbolism)

Pagan Magic (ritual structure, correspondences, sacred sites)


Acquiring “meaning” is equivalent to leveling up.


---

4.3. Branching Structure with KMAR (Knowledge-Motivated Agency Routes)

Short routes (snap judgments)
→ shallow endings, frustration, moral blindness

Long routes (investigation+empathy)
→ deep endings, narrative complexity, full truth
→ replayability


---

# 5. WHAT THE GAME IS

A psychological investigation of a rural spiritual community

A story about perception, prejudice, and interpretation

A player-driven inquiry into esoteric systems

A branching moral narrative with meaningful dead-ends

A grounded, human drama with mystical aesthetics



---

# 6. WHAT THE GAME IS NOT

(To prevent creep-in during development)

NOT a horror game

NOT a supernatural thriller

NOT a satire of spirituality

NOT an action game

NOT a story with “one true ending”

NOT a tutorial on esotericism

NOT a moral lecture



---

# 7. USABILITY & ACCESSIBILITY PILLARS

All esoteric concepts must be explained through story and usage, not textbooks.

Players should never need real-world knowledge to progress.

Choices must always feel intuitively meaningful, even if consequences are hidden.

Game length must be flexible (1 hour → 8 hours) depending on player depth.



---

# 8. PRODUCTION PILLARS

Modular writing: scenes built as independent nodes

Robust flag system for knowledge acquisition

Scopes realism: “one valley, one season, one mystery”

Iterative prototyping: test tone early

Tools-first: branching structure documented before script writing



---

✅ CPD Complete.

This is the foundation all future documents must obey.
